Please install my fork of insert_dylib (included in the dist folder in this repo, make sure to make it executable) somewhere in PATH before building.

You must also install all of the typical dev tools such as clang, GNU make, XCode, etc.

Then, you can use "make 64" to build a 64-bit version, or "make 32" to build a 32-bit version.
