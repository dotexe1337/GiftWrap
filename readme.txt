(EARLY WIP VERSION!)

GiftWrap is a third-party API extension & wrapper for older Mac OS X systems such as 10.6.x
It allows some programs which require a newer version of Mac OS X to work on the older operating system versions.
Please open an issue if you run into something that is not compatible, or you have other problems with the project.
